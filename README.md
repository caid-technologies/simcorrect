## Overview

SimCorrect is a fully autonomous pipeline for detecting, isolating, and correcting geometric faults in robot CAD models that cause sim-to-real performance gaps. Two simulation instances run side by side under identical joint commands — one with ground-truth geometry, one with an injected geometric fault. SimCorrect identifies the faulty CAD parameter, corrects it programmatically via the OpenCAD API, reloads the simulation, and verifies task success. No human intervention. No real-world hardware. No additional data collection.

## Background and Motivation

Simulation is central to modern robot development. Training and validating robot policies in simulation before real-world deployment reduces cost, accelerates iteration, and improves safety. However, the sim-to-real gap — the performance difference between a simulated and physically deployed robot — remains one of the most studied challenges in robotics.

The sim-to-real literature has produced mature solutions for two classes of gap:

**The dynamics gap** — discrepancies in friction, mass, contact forces, and actuator response. Addressed by domain randomization (Peng et al., 2018), system identification, and differentiable simulation frameworks including COMPASS (Huang et al., 2023), DREAM (Lou et al., 2024), and gradSim (Murthy et al., 2021).

**The perceptual gap** — discrepancies in visual appearance, lighting, and sensor response. Addressed by domain adaptation, sim-to-real rendering pipelines, and real-to-sim alignment methods such as RialTo (Torne et al., 2024).

A third class of gap has received considerably less systematic attention:

**The geometric gap** — discrepancies between a robot's CAD model and its physical geometry, arising from manufacturing tolerances, part substitutions, assembly errors, and model drift over time.

The 2025 Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems (Aljalbout et al.) identifies this directly: robot simulations based on CAD files "simplify or omit important physical details," and real-world factors including manufacturing tolerances and mechanical backlash "are rarely modeled" and "can cause self-collisions, unstable motions, or failed task execution."

Unlike dynamics gaps, geometric gaps are deterministic. A link that is 37% shorter than its CAD specification produces the same end-effector error at every execution of the same joint command. This determinism makes geometric faults both highly tractable and, without a dedicated correction mechanism, highly damaging — a policy trained against a geometrically incorrect simulation will fail in the real world in a consistent, reproducible way.

SimCorrect addresses this gap directly.

## How SimCorrect Works

The pipeline operates in four stages:

### Stage 1 — Behavioral Divergence Detection

Two simulation instances run concurrently under identical joint commands. The reference instance uses ground-truth CAD geometry. The faulty instance carries an injected geometric fault. SimCorrect monitors end-effector trajectories and task outcomes in real time. When the faulty arm fails a task that the reference arm completes, divergence is flagged and the correction pipeline begins.

### Stage 2 — Geometric Parameter Identification

Sensitivity analysis traces the detected divergence to its source CAD parameter. Because geometric faults produce deterministic, reproducible end-effector errors, SimCorrect isolates the exact dimension responsible — link length, joint offset, structural profile — without requiring real-world observations. The fault is a specific incorrect value in a specific CAD file.

### Stage 3 — Autonomous Correction via OpenCAD

The identified parameter is corrected programmatically through the **OpenCAD API** — a modular, service-oriented parametric CAD engine developed by CAID Technologies. OpenCAD rebuilds the affected geometry from first principles, exports the corrected file, and reloads the simulation:
```python
from opencad import Part, Sketch

# Correcting a forearm link 37% too short
Part('forearm').extrude(
    Sketch().circle(r=0.028),
    depth=0.38          # corrected from 0.24 m
).export('forearm.stl')

sim.reload('forearm.stl')
```

No human writes the correction. No human touches a file.

### Stage 4 — Closed-Loop Verification

The corrected simulation re-executes the task under the same joint commands. Success is verified programmatically. The geometric gap is closed.

## Key Properties

**Simulation-only operation.** Existing parameter identification methods require real-world robot data to optimize against. SimCorrect detects and corrects geometric faults entirely within simulation, using behavioral divergence between two simulation instances as the detection signal.

**Deterministic fault isolation.** Geometric faults produce exact, reproducible end-effector errors. SimCorrect exploits this determinism to isolate faults precisely — qualitatively different from probabilistic dynamics identification.

**Source-level correction.** Correcting the CAD model propagates automatically to every derived artifact — URDF, MJCF, collision meshes, inertial tensors, motion planning models. One correction fixes the entire simulation stack.

**Zero human intervention.** The full detect-identify-correct-verify loop runs without human input at any stage.

## Limitations

**Single-fault assumption.** The current pipeline assumes one geometric fault is present at a time. Multi-fault scenarios require extension of the sensitivity analysis to handle coupled parameter interactions.

**Simulation-internal detection.** Divergence detection currently operates between two simulation instances rather than between a simulation and a physical robot. Extending to real-world sensor data is a necessary step toward full deployment.

**Manipulation-specific demonstrations.** The three demonstration scenarios focus on robot arm pick-and-place tasks. Generalization to other robot morphologies and task types has not yet been validated.

**Fault type coverage.** The current framework targets geometric parameter faults. Other sources of the reality gap — sensor noise models, actuator dynamics, environmental contact properties — are outside the current scope.
